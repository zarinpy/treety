the total time complexity for parsing expressions is O(N * M)

N = expressions in the input list

M = average number of tokens (operators, operands, and variables)

The parsing of each expression takes O(M) time


The space complexity of the dependency graph is O(V + E), where V is the number of variables (nodes) and E is the number of edges.
