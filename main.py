def sortExpressions(expressions):
    """
        Sorts algebraic expressions based on their dependencies.

        Parameters:
            expressions (list): A list of strings representing algebraic expressions.
                                Each expression has a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS)
                                separated by an equal-to sign. The LHS is a single operand, and the RHS
                                is an algebraic formula built using operators and operands separated by
                                a single space.

        Returns:
            list: A list of sorted algebraic expressions in the order they can be solved, or
                  ["cyclic_dependency"] if a cyclic dependency is detected.
